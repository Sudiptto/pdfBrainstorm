# pdfBrainstorm

For the BAM 2023 Final Computer science project

What is pdfBrainstorm?

Well it's the ultimate resource for teachers, want to generate free response questions, multiple choice and more? Than look no further. But wait? Doesn't resources like this already exist? Well they might but in this resource teachers can upload a pdf and then from there they can get questions generated based on the text + they can recieve the answers for it but students cannot. This is a teacher only site (no STUDENTS!)
