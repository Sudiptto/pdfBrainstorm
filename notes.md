Issues found:'


When testing,  I tried a bunch of different documents, from US history books, to my own documents. At first I thought the larger the document the harder it was to extract text. However with more research I found out that the issue was the microsoft print to pdf.

In order for the pyPDF to work it has to be PDF with text that you can copy, paste, etc. This happens when you download the text and not do print to pdf. When you do print to pdf it does not work as the text is copyable.

This is because when you use Microsoft Print to PDF it treats the PDF as an image and not text so it's not copyable.

This is not a space issue!

Note: Download instead of microsoft text to pdf!



Second Issue Founded:

Text length! I am testing documents that stretch up to 70 pages and one huge issue is chat gpt limitation and their text limitation so I am going to use index slicing to limit the amount of characters to under 10,000, for example using the first 8,000 characters


Limits, I am limited by openai, I only have 5$, the more complex questions I want the higher amount of tokens I will need


Issue #3:

Using less javascript, before I did a project using mostly the FetchAPI in javascript with flask and it was a very difficult project. I had some issues with python and javascript so I just sticked to POST methods in python

Issue #4

I am limited by OpenAI!

Steps For tomorrow (7/25):
Fully set up the database, use past code for reference. Since this program is only for teachers make sure to have it to where the users will have to login based on a username and password I give them. (Limits students from making an account)

Steps, make a password hash for tomorrow or if you can later.
