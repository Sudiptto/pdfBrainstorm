Issues found:'


When testing,  I tried a bunch of different documents, from US history books, to my own documents. At first I thought the larger the document the harder it was to extract text. However with more research I found out that the issue was the microsoft print to pdf.

In order for the pyPDF to work it has to be PDF with text that you can copy, paste, etc. This happens when you download the text and not do print to pdf. When you do print to pdf it does not work as the text is copyable.

This is because when you use Microsoft Print to PDF it treats the PDF as an image and not text so it's not copyable.

This is not a space issue!

Note: Download instead of microsoft text to pdf!
